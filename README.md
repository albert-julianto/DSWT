Designing and simulating the wind turbine vensys 170
This group project was developed as part of the "Design and Simulation of Wind Turbines" course at the Technical University of Berlin
### ðŸ“Œ Overview
The goal of this project is to design the wind turbine VENSYS 170 and certify it through a selection of relevant aeroelastic load simulations.
### ðŸ§° Tools & Tech Stack
- QBlade is mainly used to design the wind turbine, create wind profiles, and run simulations.
- IEC Wind was also used alongside to create wind profiles.
- PDAP alongside a python script is used for post-processing purposes.
